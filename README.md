### Move-To-Front

**This Algorithm Increased Temporal Locality by decaoding the more common showed up letters to the front.**

_-> Original string:_

_Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself._

_-> Decoded seq:_
